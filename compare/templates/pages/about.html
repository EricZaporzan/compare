  <p>
    This website is still very much under construction. I'm offering no warranties or guarantees about the stability,
    longevity, or quality of the software; it's provided "as-is". Feel free to use the site to your heart's content;
    If you happen to find any bugs or problems (I'm sure you will), please contact me through the links above.

  <h3 class="card-title">Security and Privacy</h3>
  <p>
    I've done my best to ensure the site is secure by following best-practices for encryption, password storage, and protection of
    personal information. However, this site is effectively in pre-alpha. Don't yet provide information to the site that you
    wouldn't feel comfortable posting publically. Don't reuse passwords from other sites. That last part is good advice in general.
